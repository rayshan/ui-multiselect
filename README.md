ui-multiselect
==============

An inline multiselect with typeahead built as an AngularJS directive.

[Demo](http://shan.io/ui-multiselect/demo.html)

<!-- [Why and how this was built](medium.com). -->

How to Use
----------

Include:

*	ui-multiselect.html
* ui-multiselect.js
* ui-multiselect.css (edit for your own styling)

Dependencies
------------

Aim is no dependency besides AngularJS.

Unfortunately angular-ui's ui-utils is needed, specifically ui-event, to bind focus & blur of input. See [this AngularJS issue](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1277).
